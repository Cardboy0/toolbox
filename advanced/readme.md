# Folder for more advanced stuff

This folder contains - as the name implies - more advanced stuff that might be too complex to understand or even work with for beginners.  
That's why I put them in their own folder, basically as a slight warning.

Additionally, testing done to these scripts is limited, and so are their abilities as well as their performance.

## What repository???
If, for some reason, this readme file exists as a lone file on your computer, or the parent folder disappeared:
It's part of the "**toolbox**" repository (development by me, Cardboy0), which you can find at 
https://github.com/Cardboy0/toolbox along with more information
